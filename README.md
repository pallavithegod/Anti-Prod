Tired of being productive? Deadlines got you down?  
Introducing **Anti-Productivity Reminder** â€” a Chrome Extension that does the *exact opposite* of every focus tool out there.  

Instead of helping you concentrate, it makes sure youâ€™re constantly distracted â€” with:  
- ðŸš¨ **Pop-up reminders** every 10 minutes (auto-dismiss in 10 seconds).  
- ðŸŽ¬ **Links to the best black holes of time**: Instagram, Twitter controversies, Reddit rabbit holes, YouTube spirals & more.  
- ðŸ˜œ A **dark, minimal distraction hub** right inside Chrome.  

Because why chase gradesâ€¦ when you can chase memes?
